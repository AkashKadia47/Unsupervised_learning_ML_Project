# Unsupervised_learning_ML_Project

### Project Description
In this project, we have applied unsupervised learning techniques to a real-world data set and use data visualization tools to communicate the insights gained from the analysis.

The data set for this project is the "Wholesale Data" dataset containing information about various products sold by a grocery store. The project will involve the following tasks:

Exploratory data analysis and pre-processing: We will import and clean the data sets, analyze and visualize the relationships between the different variables, handle missing values and outliers, and perform feature engineering as needed. Unsupervised learning: We will use the Wholesale Data dataset to perform k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA) to identify patterns and group similar data points together. We will determine the optimal number of clusters and communicate the insights gained through data visualization. The ultimate goal of the project is to gain insights from the data sets and communicate these insights to stakeholders using appropriate visualizations and metrics to make informed decisions based on the business questions asked.

### Project Outcomes
Unsupervised Learning: perform unsupervised learning techniques on a wholesale data dataset. The project involves four main parts: exploratory data analysis and pre-processing, KMeans clustering, hierarchical clustering, and PCA.

### Conclusion
1. The scatter plot obtained from K-means clustering shows more scattered and disrupted data points, indicating that the clusters may not be well-defined or separated in the reduced space.<br>
In contrast, the hierarchical clustering diagram exhibits well-defined clusters, suggesting that the algorithm has effectively grouped similar data points together based on the similarity measure, resulting in more cohesive and distinct clusters.

2. **Hypothesis Confirmation**: 
The PCA visualization of customer purchasing behavior supports the hypothesis that distinct customer segments exist. By reducing the original feature space to two principal components (PCA 1 and PCA 2), we are able to effectively capture the key patterns and variations in the data.

3. Clustering Interpretation:

- Cluster 1: The data points clustered in this region of the PCA plot correspond to customers who exhibit a preference for certain product categories, such as 'Fresh' and 'Frozen'. This suggests a segment of customers who prioritize perishable and easily consumable items.
- Cluster 2: Data points in this cluster are associated with higher values along 'Milk', 'Grocery', and 'Detergents_Paper' categories. This might represent customers who often purchase household essentials and everyday items.
- Cluster 3: Customers in this cluster demonstrate a diverse range of purchases across all categories. This could indicate a segment of general or bulk shoppers who cover a wide spectrum of products.

4. Business Insights:

- The identified clusters provide valuable insights for targeted marketing, inventory management, and customer engagement strategies.
- Businesses can tailor their product offerings, promotions, and communication to cater to the specific preferences of each segment.
- Inventory management can be optimized based on the purchasing patterns of different clusters.
